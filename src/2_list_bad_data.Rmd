This document will list the daily zips of pvol data that are unusable for processing.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Load libraries:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(here)
```

Read coverage:

```{r}
coverage <- read_csv(here::here("data", "processed", "coverage.csv"))
```

Add columns:

```{r}
coverage <-
  coverage %>%
  
  # country
  mutate(country = recode(str_sub(radar, 1, 2),
    "be" = "belgium",
    "cz" = "czechia",
    "dk" = "denmark",
    "ee" = "estonia",
    "fi" = "finland",
    "fr" = "france",
    "de" = "germany",
    "nl" = "netherlands",
    "pl" = "poland",
    "pt" = "portugal",
    "sk" = "slovakia",
    "si" = "slovenia",
    "es" = "spain",
    "se" = "sweden"
  )) %>%
  
  # path
  mutate(path = paste(
   country,
   format(date1, "%Y"),
   paste0(format(date1, "%Y%m%d"), ".tgz"),
   sep = "/"
  )) %>%

  # scan_and_pvol_count
  mutate(scan_and_pvol_count = scan_count + pvol_count)
```

Filter on data where **all files** have no `VRADH` or no `DBZH`:

```{r}
coverage %>%
  filter(scan_and_pvol_count == error_no_vradh | scan_and_pvol_count == error_no_dbzh) %>%
  nrow()
```
